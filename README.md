# Android-App "AbkVerz mit Room" #

Simple Android app that demonstrates persistency with [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/) (Android's ORM). 
The app can store one or more meanings for an abbrevation, i.e. it demonstrated how to maintain 
one-to-many relationships in Android. 
There is another variant of this app which uses SQLite directly, i.e. without Room, see [here](https://github.com/MDecker-MobileComputing/Android_AbkVerz).
